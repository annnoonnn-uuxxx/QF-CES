Task Description: 

You will be given comprehensive information about three recommended products for a user query, including the query itself, product titles, base prices, final prices, and product opinion summaries. Next, you will be provided with one comparative summary created using this product information. Your task is to carefully follow each and every evaluation criterion and instruction and always provide a faithful, truthful, and accurate output in the specified format. You must evaluate and assign a single score ranging from 1 to 5 to the comparative summary, according to the metric called  faithfulness. Make sure you fully understand the evaluation metric described below. Your task is to rate the summary based on the given product information using the specified evaluation criteria.

Metric: Faithfulness -  Faithfulness measures the degree to which the information presented in the Comparative Summary is accurate, verifiable, and directly supported by the input data. The Comparative Summary must faithfully represent the content provided, ensuring that all details, including the query and attributes of each product are correct and inferred directly from the input. Comparative Summary will be penalized for any information that cannot be verified from the input data or if they make broad generalizations that are not supported by the input data.

Evaluation Criteria:

Following are the scores and the evaluation criteria according to which scores must be assigned to the summary:

<score>1</score> - Very Poor
- The summary contains mostly inaccurate or unverifiable information.
- Multiple critical details about products are incorrect or fabricated.
- The comparison does not reflect the input data at all.

<score>2</score> - Poor
- The summary contains several inaccuracies or unverifiable claims.
- Some important product details are misrepresented or omitted.
- The comparison only loosely reflects the input data.

<score>3</score> - OK
- The summary is partially accurate but contains more than one piece of unverifiable information.
- Most critical product details are correct, but there are some inaccuracies or overgeneralizations.
- The comparison somewhat reflects the input data, but with noticeable discrepancies.

<score>4</score> - Good
- The summary is mostly accurate with only one minor piece of unverifiable information.
- Almost all product details are correctly represented.
- The comparison closely reflects the input data with minor inconsistencies.

<score>5</score> - Excellent
- The summary is completely accurate and verifiable from the input data.
- All product details are correctly represented without any fabrications or overgeneralizations.
- The comparison perfectly reflects the input data and query.

Evaluation Steps:

Follow these steps strictly while giving the response:

1. First, write down the steps needed to evaluate the Comparative Summary as per the faithfulness metric. Reiterate what metric you will be using to evaluate the summary.
2. Cross-check every piece of information in the summary with the input data, ensuring that it can be verified. 
3. Verify the numerical consistency by cross-checking all numerical values (including prices, ratings, and any other quantitative data) in the summary against the corresponding values in the input data for all three products, ensuring accurate representation and comparison.
4. Ensure that all facts, comparisons, and claims in the summary are correctly represented and inferred from the input data.
5. Identify any instances of inaccuracies, unsupported information, or overgeneralizations.
6. Evaluate the extent to which the faithfulness metric is followed overall.
7. Based on your evaluation, assign a score using the evaluation criteria and provide it within the <score></score> tags.

Your response should follow this structure:

1. Provide a detailed explanation of your faithfulness evaluation, referencing specific aspects of the summary and how they adhere to or deviate from the input data.
2. Clearly state which score range this falls into, referencing the evaluation criteria.
3. Assign a single score based on the evaluation, using the exact format shown below.

Score format: Score- <score>X</score>
Where X is the assigned score (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) based on the evaluation criteria.

Remember, your final score must always be presented in this exact format, with no deviations. 

THE EVALUATION AND SCORE MUST BE ASSIGNED STRICTLY ACCORDING TO THE FAITHFULNESS METRIC ONLY AND NOTHING ELSE!
