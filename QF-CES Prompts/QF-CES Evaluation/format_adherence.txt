Task Description: 

You will be given comprehensive information about three recommended products for a user query, including the query itself, product titles, base prices, final prices, and product opinion summaries. Next, you will be provided with one comparative summary created using this product information. Your task is to carefully follow each and every evaluation criterion and instruction and always provide a faithful, truthful, and accurate output in the specified format. You must evaluate and assign a single score ranging from 1 to 5 to the comparative summary, according to the metric called format adherence. Make sure you fully understand the evaluation metric described below. Your task is to rate the summary based on the given product information using the specified evaluation criteria.

Metric: Format Adherence - This metric evaluates the extent to which the Comparative Summary follows the prescribed format. The Comparative Summary should consist of two main parts: 
1) A tabular comparison of the three products
2) A final verdict summary. 
The tabular comparison should list products in columns and attributes in rows, including dynamically selected attributes based on the user query and essential attributes such as Base Price, Final Price, Average Rating, Pros, and Cons. It verifies that dynamically selected attributes are appropriately named and not using placeholders. The final verdict summary should provide a concise overview of the comparison among three products. The metric assesses the presence, completeness, and proper formatting of both these components (the tabular comparison along with the final verdict), as well as the overall organization and consistency of the entire summary.

Evaluation Criteria:

Following are the scores and the evaluation criteria according to which scores must be assigned to the summary:

<score>1</score> - Very Poor
- The summary lacks either the tabular comparison or the final verdict summary, or both.
- The information is presented in a highly disorganized manner.
- Dynamically selected attributes are missing or use placeholders.
- Essential attributes (Base Price, Final Price, Average Rating, Pros, and Cons) are largely absent.

<score>2</score> - Poor
- The summary includes both a tabular comparison and a final verdict summary, but with significant structural issues.
- The tabular comparison is incomplete or poorly organized.
- Some dynamically selected attributes are named, while others use placeholders or are missing.
- Several essential attributes are missing or incompletely presented.
- The final verdict summary is present but lacks coherence.

<score>3</score> - OK
- The summary includes both a tabular comparison and a final verdict summary with a mostly correct structure.
- The tabular comparison is present but may have some inconsistencies in formatting or organization.
- Most dynamically selected attributes are appropriately named, but some may use placeholders.
- Most essential attributes are present, but some may be incomplete.
- The final verdict summary is present and provides some useful information, but may lack details about three recommended products.

<score>4</score> - Good
- The summary includes a well-structured tabular comparison and a comprehensive final verdict summary.
- The tabular comparison is properly formatted with products in columns and attributes in rows.
- Almost all dynamically selected attributes are appropriately named.
- All essential attributes are present and complete, with only minor omissions or formatting issues.
- The final verdict summary is present and provides most of the useful information and omits minor details about three recommended products.

<score>5</score> - Excellent
- The summary includes a perfectly structured tabular comparison and a highly informative final verdict summary.
- The tabular comparison is flawlessly formatted with products in columns and attributes in rows.
- All dynamically selected attributes are appropriately named with clear, context-specific labels.
- All essential attributes are present, complete, and properly formatted for all products.
- The final verdict summary provides comprehensive insights about three recommended products.

Evaluation Steps:

Follow these steps strictly while giving the response:

1. First, write down the steps needed to evaluate the Comparative Summary as per the format adherence metric. Reiterate what metric you will be using to evaluate the summary.
2. Check for the presence of both the tabular comparison and the final verdict summary.
3. Evaluate the tabular comparison:
   a. Verify that products are listed in columns and attributes in rows.
   b. Check that dynamically selected attributes are appropriately named and free of placeholders.
   c. Confirm the presence and completeness of essential attributes: Base Price, Final Price, Average Rating, Pros, and Cons for all products.
4. Evaluate the final verdict summary:
   a. Check that it provides an overview of the comparison.
   b. Verify that it offers clear insights about the three recommended products.
5. Assess the overall structure, organization, and consistency of the entire summary.
6. Look for any formatting inconsistencies or typographical errors that affect the presentation.
7. Based on your evaluation, assign a score using the evaluation criteria and provide it within the <score></score> tags.

Your response should follow this structure:

1. Provide a detailed explanation of your format adherence evaluation, referencing specific aspects of the summary and how they contribute to or detract from its adherence to the prescribed format.
2. Clearly state which score range this falls into, referencing the evaluation criteria.
3. Assign a single score based on the evaluation, using the exact format shown below.

Score format: Score- <score>X</score>
Where X is the assigned score (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) based on the evaluation criteria.

Remember, your final score must always be presented in this exact format, with no deviations. 

THE EVALUATION AND SCORE MUST BE ASSIGNED STRICTLY ACCORDING TO THE FORMAT ADHERENCE METRIC ONLY AND NOTHING ELSE!
