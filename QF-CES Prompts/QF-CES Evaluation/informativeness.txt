Task Description: 

You will be given comprehensive information about three recommended products for a user query, including the query itself, product titles, base prices, final prices, and product opinion summaries. Next, you will be provided with one comparative summary created using this product information. Your task is to carefully follow each and every evaluation criterion and instruction and always provide a faithful, truthful, and accurate output in the specified format. You must evaluate and assign a single score ranging from 1 to 5 to the comparative summary, according to the metric called informativeness. Make sure you fully understand the evaluation metric described below. Your task is to rate the summary based on the given product information using the specified evaluation criteria.

Metric: Informativeness - Informativeness evaluates the extent to which the Comparative Summary comprehensively covers all relevant aspects and attributes of the products being compared. This metric assesses the presence and completeness of essential attributes and features in the comparison, including the product title, base price, final price, key attributes dynamically selected from the product opinion summaries, pros, cons, and average rating. The summary should ensure that all majorly discussed aspects are covered and any missing values are properly marked as "N/A". Summaries should be penalized for missing significant aspects and rewarded for thorough coverage of the aspects from the provided information.

Evaluation Criteria:

Following are the scores and the evaluation criteria according to which scores must be assigned to the summary:

<score>1</score> - Very Poor
- The summary fails to cover most important aspects from the given input.
- Essential attributes like product titles, prices, or ratings are largely missing.
- The comparison provides minimal information for decision-making.

<score>2</score> - Poor
- The summary covers only a few important aspects from the given input.
- Several essential attributes are missing or incompletely presented.
- The comparison provides limited information for product comparison.

<score>3</score> - OK
- The summary covers about half of the important aspects from the given input.
- Most essential attributes are present, but some may be incomplete.
- The comparison provides a moderate level of information, but significant gaps remain.

<score>4</score> - Good
- The summary covers most important aspects from the given input.
- Almost all essential attributes are present and complete.
- The comparison provides substantial information, with only minor omissions.

<score>5</score> - Excellent
- The summary comprehensively covers all important aspects from the given input.
- All essential attributes are present, complete, and properly formatted.
- The comparison provides a thorough and detailed information set for decision-making.

Evaluation Steps:

Follow these steps strictly while giving the response:

1. First, write down the steps needed to evaluate the Comparative Summary as per the informativeness metric. Reiterate what metric you will be using to evaluate the summary.
2. List all essential attributes (product title, base price, final price, key attributes, pros, cons, average rating) and check their presence and completeness in the summary for all three products.
3. Identify the key aspects discussed in each product's opinion summary and verify their inclusion in the comparative summary.
4. Check if any missing values are properly marked as "N/A".
5. Assess how well the summary dynamically selects and includes important attributes from the given input.
6. Evaluate the overall comprehensiveness of the comparison, considering both essential attributes and key aspects from the given input.
7. Based on your evaluation, assign a score using the evaluation criteria and provide it within the <score></score> tags.

Your response should follow this structure:

1. Provide a detailed explanation of your informativeness evaluation, referencing specific aspects of the summary and how they contribute to or detract from its informativeness.
2. Clearly state which score range this falls into, referencing the evaluation criteria.
3. Assign a single score based on the evaluation, using the exact format shown below.

Score format: Score- <score>X</score>
Where X is the assigned score (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) based on the evaluation criteria.

Remember, your final score must always be presented in this exact format, with no deviations. 

THE EVALUATION AND SCORE MUST BE ASSIGNED STRICTLY ACCORDING TO THE INFORMATIVENESS METRIC ONLY AND NOTHING ELSE!
