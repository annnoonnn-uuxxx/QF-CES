Task Description: 

You will be given comprehensive information about three recommended products for a user query, including the query itself, product titles, base prices, final prices, and product opinion summaries. Next, you will be provided with one comparative summary created using this product information. Your task is to carefully follow each and every evaluation criterion and instruction and always provide a faithful, truthful, and accurate output in the specified format. You must evaluate and assign a single score ranging from 1 to 5 to the comparative summary, according to the metric called query relevance. Make sure you fully understand the evaluation metric described below. Your task is to rate the summary based on the given product information using the specified evaluation criteria.

Metric: Query Relevance - This metric evaluates how well the Comparative Summary addresses the user's query. It assesses two main components:
1) The tabular comparison: Ensures that only the most relevant information and dynamic attributes are present, directly addressing the user query without including irrelevant details.
2) The final verdict summary: Verifies that the user query is explicitly addressed, providing clear suggestions that enable the user to make an informed buying decision.
The metric measures the overall relevance and usefulness of the Comparative Summary in helping the user make an informed decision based on their specific query.

Evaluation Criteria:

Following are the scores and the evaluation criteria according to which scores must be assigned to the summary:

<score>1</score> - Very Poor
- The tabular comparison includes mostly irrelevant information or attributes unrelated to the user query.
- The final verdict summary fails to address the user query and provides no clear suggestions.
- The overall summary is not helpful for making an informed decision based on the query.

<score>2</score> - Poor
- The tabular comparison includes some relevant information, but also contains many irrelevant details or attributes.
- The final verdict summary barely addresses the user query and provides vague or unhelpful suggestions.
- The overall summary is of limited use for making an informed decision based on the query.

<score>3</score> - OK
- The tabular comparison includes mostly relevant information and attributes, with some irrelevant details.
- The final verdict summary addresses the user query to some extent but may lack clarity in its suggestions.
- The overall summary is somewhat helpful for making an informed decision based on the query.

<score>4</score> - Good
- The tabular comparison includes relevant information and attributes, with minimal irrelevant details.
- The final verdict summary addresses the user query well and provides clear suggestions, with minor ambiguities.
- The overall summary is helpful for making an informed decision based on the query.

<score>5</score> - Excellent
- The tabular comparison includes only relevant information and attributes that directly address the user query.
- The final verdict summary explicitly addresses the user query and provides very clear, specific suggestions for decision-making.
- The overall summary is extremely helpful for making an informed decision based on the query.

Evaluation Steps:

Follow these steps strictly while giving the response:

1. First, write down the steps needed to evaluate the Comparative Summary as per the query relevance metric.  	Reiterate what metric you will be using to evaluate the summary.
2. Carefully analyze the user query to understand the specific requirements and preferences.
3. Evaluate the tabular comparison:
   a. Check if the dynamic attributes selected are relevant to the user query.
   b. Verify that no irrelevant information or attributes are included.
4. Evaluate the final verdict summary:
   a. Ensure that it explicitly addresses the user query.
   b. Check if it provides clear and specific suggestions for decision-making.
   c. Verify that it helps the user make an informed buying decision without confusion.
5. Assess the overall relevance and usefulness of the entire Comparative Summary in relation to the user query.
6. Based on your evaluation, assign a score using the evaluation criteria and provide it within the <score></score> tags.

Your response should follow this structure:

1. Provide a detailed explanation of your query relevance evaluation, referencing specific aspects of the summary and how they address or fail to address the user query.
2. Clearly state which score range this falls into, referencing the evaluation criteria.
3. Assign a single score based on the evaluation, using the exact format shown below.

Score format: Score- <score>X</score>
Where X is the assigned score (1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) based on the evaluation criteria.

Remember, your final score must always be presented in this exact format, with no deviations. 

THE EVALUATION AND SCORE MUST BE ASSIGNED STRICTLY ACCORDING TO THE QUERY RELEVANCE METRIC ONLY AND NOTHING ELSE!
